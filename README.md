# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.
## Radix Sort

The Radix sort algorithm works by ordering each digit from least significant to most significant. 

The algorithm is implemented in C.
